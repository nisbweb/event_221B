Inside the briefcase Sherlock finds a pendrive and some boarding passes. He keeps the passes with him for further investigation and inserts the pendrive in his laptop.
On opening the pendrive, Sherlock is baffled and he couldn't figure what could these confusing files hide. He tries to open the files and make a sense out of it, but fails.
The only thing he is able to figure out is that there is some connection between all the files and he has to find out some specific word which on entering in the url might lead him somewhere.
But what could that word possibly be?
